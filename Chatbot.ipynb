            "System: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) refers to a type of machine learning that uses algorithms and statistical models to generate new data or content based on existing data sets. This can include text, images, audio, video, and other forms of media. The goal of generative AI is to create something original and unique while still maintaining some level of consistency with the source material. For example, an algorithm might be trained on a large dataset of paintings by Van Gogh in order to produce its own version of his style. Another application could involve generating realistic-looking faces from scratch using deep neural networks. In general, these systems are designed for tasks such as image synthesis, language generation, music composition, and more. They have been used across various industries including entertainment, advertising, healthcare, finance, education, etc., where they help automate repetitive processes or provide creative solutions when human input isn’t feasible due to time constraints or cost considerations.\n"
