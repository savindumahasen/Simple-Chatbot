            "AI: Sure, here is a brief summary of Dr APJ Abdul Kalam’s life and accomplishments:\n",
            "Dr APJ Abdul Kalam was born on October 15th, 1931 in Rameswaram, India. He grew up in a poor family but had an insatiable curiosity for science and technology from a young age. After completing his education at St Joseph’s College in Tiruchirappalli, he joined the Indian Defense Research & Development Organization (DRDO) as a scientist.\n",
            "In 1962, during the Indo-China war, he worked with DRDO to develop missile systems that could be used by the Indian Army against Chinese forces. His work led him to become one of the key figures behind India’s successful development of nuclear weapons capabilities. In addition to this role within defense research, he also served as Director General of Aeronautical Systems Development Establishment (ASDE), where he helped design aircraft such as Tejas Light Combat Aircraft (LCA).\n",
            "After retiring from government service in 1984, Dr Kalam continued working towards advancing scientific knowledge through various projects including developing low cost satellites for space exploration purposes; establishing educational institutions like Sathyabama University which focuses on providing quality higher education opportunities especially among underprivileged sections of society; writing books about leadership principles etc., all while maintaining close ties with students across different parts of India who looked up to him as their mentor/guide/role model/inspiration throughout their lives .\n",
            "Overall , it would not be wrong if we say that Dr APJ Abdul Kalam has left behind an indelible mark on our country due to his immense contributions both professionally & personally towards making us proud citizens worldwide !\n"
